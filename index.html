        <p>What is the G20? The Group of 20 is an organization of finance ministers and central bank governors from 19 individual countries and the European Union.</p>

        <p>In addition to the United States, those countries are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Britain, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea and Turkey. Collectively, its members represent more than 80 percent of the world’s gross domestic product.​</p>

        <p>Established in 1999 after a series of major international debt crises, the G20 aims to unite world leaders around shared economic, political and health challenges. It is a creation of the more select Group of 7, an informal bloc of industrialized democracies. Supporters argue that as national economies grow ever more globalized, it is essential that political and finance leaders work closely together.</p>

        <p>The following article will give some Infographic's of the healthcare, education and military spendings of the G-20 countries. We will compare the spendings with the GDP of each country, as well as the GDP per capita. The data was retrived from the World bank, and its from the year 2000 to 2018. Some missing values were estimated by a simple mean calculation.</p>
